# A Fading Channel Simulation and OFDM Transmission
+ Simulation of a Fading Channel (Fading_Channel.p)
  + Rayleigh Distribution used
+ Tranmission of OFDM Symbols over the channel
  + Uncoded (Main_Uncoded.m)
  + Coded: Repetiton coding scheme (Main_Coded_Diversity.m)
    + Diversity: 1, 2 and 3
+ Note: Cannot run in Octave due to the .p (MATLAB obfuscated file). Must be ran in MATLAB
