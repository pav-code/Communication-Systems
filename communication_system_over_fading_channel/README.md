# A Fading Channel Simulation and OFDM Transmission
+ Simulation of a Fading Channel
  + Rayleigh Distribution used
  + Fading_Channel.p
+ Tranmission of OFDM Symbols over the channel
  + Uncoded
    + Main_Uncoded.m
  + Coded: Repetiton coding scheme
    + Diversity: 1, 2 and 3
    + Main_Coded_Diversity.m
+ Note: Cannot run in Octave due to the .p (MATLAB obfuscated file). Must be ran in MATLAB
