Decoupling Capacitors:
• Place the lowest valued capacitor as close as possible to the device to minimize the inductive influence
of the trace. This is especially important for small capacitor values, because the inductive influence of
the trace is not negligible anymore.
• Place the lowest valued capacitor as close as possible to the power pin/power trace of the device.
• Connect the pad of the capacitor directly with a via to the ground plane. Use two or three vias to get a
low-impedance connection to ground. If the distance to the ground pin of the device is short enough,
you can connect it directly.
• Make sure that the signal must flow along the capacitor.

On Vias:
• The use of vias is essential in most routings. But the designer has to be careful when using them. They
add additional inductance and capacitance, and reflections occur due to the change in the characteristic
impedance. Vias also increase the trace length.
• The designer has to make sure that the
return current can flow ideally underneath (beside) the signal trace. A good way to realize this is to add
some ground vias around the signal via. This is a similar structure to a coaxial line.
• Be careful with the return current when changing the layers. Use ground vias around the signal via to
make sure that the return current can flow as close as possible to the signal (Figure 14).
• Do not create slots, for example in the ground plane, by using closely placed vias (Figure 15).

• Impedance matching is critical for maximum power transfer. Additionally, electromagnetic radiation and 
capacitive coupling among the elements causes unintentional losses.
• SmartRF studio is a powerful tool for prototyping designs
• impedance of the trace is critical factor for delivering maximum power out of the balun-filter section 
to the antenna
• The ground plane should be continuous; if it is divided, especially under the RF
path, it can increase the return current’s path length and can significantly affect the desired
performance
• A source of high frequency noise on a PCB can be the transient demand of current
(power) by active devices, causing high frequency harmonics to be generated. The
generated noise can travel to the power supply pins of the devices, producing undesired
performance. To prevent this high frequency noise from reaching the power supply pins of the
devices it is bypassed to the ground plane using a capacitor which provides a low impedance
path to the high frequency noise.
• Additionally, the bypass/decoupling capacitor must be carefully selected taking into consideration 
the self resonance frequency (SRF) of the capacitor. Above the SRF the capacitor behaves as an
inductor, and thus a capacitor is effective only up to SRF. 
• It is recommended to keep decoupling/bypass capacitors as close as possible to the supply pins.
• Additionally, on the top component plane it is usually a good idea to fill the unused area with
ground plane and then connect this top fill with the ground plane below with several vias. It is
the recommended to have these vias spaced about 1/10 of the wavelength apart.
• Inductors on the PCB have associated with them a magnetic field which can couple with other
components and can affect the design performance in undesired manner, if not taken into
account.
• Verify that the top ground pours are stitched to the ground plane layer and bottom
layer with many vias around the RF signal path. Compare to the reference design.
Vias on the rest of the board should be no more than λ/10 apart.
• it is recommended to keep RF traces short, unlike cases 5(b) and
5(c). Longer traces as in 5(b) introduce undesired impedance changes and affect the
matching network, leading to undesired performance
• Bypassing: Do not have vias between the capacitor and active device.
• It is recommended not to place the silkscreen markings below the area where the chip is to
be placed as it provides obstructions for the chip to be soldered properly to the PCB pads,
leading to undesired performance
• The area under the chip on CCXXXX devices is used for ground connection and shall be
connected to the ground plane with several vias for good thermal performance and
sufficiently low inductance to ground.
